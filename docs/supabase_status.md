# Supabase Database Implementation Status

This document captures the current state of Supabase database implementation. All implementation details are maintained in JSON exports to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Implementation Details

### Functions
All database functions are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Public_Functions.json`, including:
- `matches_any_label` for efficient JSONB filtering
- `check_reservation_constraints` for status validation
- Admin functions for reservation management
- Queue position management functions

### Triggers
Trigger definitions are maintained in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Triggers.json`, including:
- Queue management triggers
- Reservation constraint checks
- Expiration handling
- Audit logging triggers

### RLS Policies
Row Level Security policies are defined in `supabase_exports/Supabase_RLS_Policies.json`, implementing:
- Alias-based access control
- Admin function security
- Queue position integrity
- Reservation constraints

### Indexes
Database indexes are specified in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Indexes.json`, optimizing:
- JSONB searches on labels
- Queue position queries
- Status and condition filters
- Price range searches

### Status Enums
Reservation status values are defined in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Enums.json`:
- 'in_cart': Initial cart addition
- 'reserved': Active reservation
- 'in_queue': Waiting list position
- 'expired': Past 7-day period
- 'sold': Completed purchase
- 'cancelled': User cancellation

## Migration Considerations

When rebuilding:
1. Preserve all functions as they handle critical business logic
2. Maintain RLS policies for security
3. Keep trigger functions for data integrity
4. Preserve custom types/enums
5. Re-create indexes for performance

## Verification Steps

After migration:
1. Test admin functions with various scenarios
2. Verify queue position management
3. Check status transition constraints
4. Validate audit logging functionality
5. Test alias-based security
