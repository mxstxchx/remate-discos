# Supabase Database Implementation Status

This document captures the current state of Supabase database implementation.

## Implementation Details

Current implementation details are maintained in the following exports:

### Functions
All database functions are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Public_Functions.json`

### Triggers
All database triggers are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Triggers.json`

### RLS Policies
Row Level Security policies are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_RLS_Policies.json`

### Indexes
Database indexes are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Indexes.json`

### Enums
Enumerated types are documented in `supabase_exports/Supabase_Enums.json`

## Migration Considerations

When rebuilding:
1. Preserve all functions as they handle critical business logic
2. Maintain RLS policies for security
3. Keep trigger functions for data integrity
4. Preserve custom types/enums
5. Re-create indexes for performance

## Verification Steps

After migration:
1. Test admin functions with various scenarios
2. Verify queue position management
3. Check status transition constraints
4. Validate audit logging functionality
5. Test alias-based security

## Notes
For the exact current definitions of database objects, refer to the corresponding JSON files in the supabase_exports directory.
